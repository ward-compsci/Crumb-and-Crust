# Crumb and Crust

## Introduction
Crumb and Crust is a project that implements our novel sampling algorithm, the 'Crumb and Crust' sampling method, to sample a space with a known topology. This version of the algorithm is designed to create a lookup table that maps measurements of light intensity to changes in physiological concentrations of chromophores in the forearm. The project is written in MATLAB.

## Requirements
To use this project, you need the NIRFASTer MATLAB library. You can download it from [NIRFASTer website](http://www.nirfast.co.uk/).

## Installation
To install and set up the Crumb and Crust project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ward-compsci/Crumb-and-Crust.git

## Test
Most features have an appropriate test. The full Crumb-and-Crust directory should be preloaded in the path to run them, and some require the NIRFASTer directory to be loaded as well.
